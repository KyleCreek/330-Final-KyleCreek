# 330-Final-KyleCreek
Week 10 Final Project Thoughts:
-------------------------------
- Railway App Generate Domain: 330-final-kylecreek-production.up.railway.app
- Self Evaluation:
  - What I Learned:
  - What I would Improve Upon:
  - What Worked Well:
  - What Didn't Work Well:

Week 8 - Proof of Concept Update.

What has Been Completed:
-------------------------------
- All Model Schemas have been defined
- General Express FrameWork has been established (Server / Router / test-utils, etc).
- Local Mongo connection ha been established (Still needs to be Set up for Host Server)
- Data Acceess Object Files have Frame Work. Some are partially complete
- All CRUD Operations for /bet and /parlay have been defined (Not within their Routes, but the Testing has determined the required end points).
- Authorization Routes, DAOs, Associated Tests have been completed.
- /Bet end point routes, DAO, and testing end points have been partially completed
- /Parlay end point routes and testing end points have been partially defined.
- Partial Completion of POSTMAN End Point Testing

What Remains to Be Completed:
--------------------------------
- Complete /Bet End Points / DAOs / Test Script
- Complete /Parlay End Points / DAOs / Test Script
- Finish associated POSTMAN end point tests (For Demonstration).
- Upload Completed (and tested) Code to Railways
- Verify end points with POSTMAN Tests
- Complete associated Slides / Presentation for Final Project
- Update Final Project "Read Me".
- Turn in Assignment for completion. 



1. Description of the Scenario Project is Operating In.

- This project is intended to mimic a piece of an application I have long dreamt about but failed to ever develop. The concept of this application is essentially the "Tinder for Gambling". In this operating environment, users create bets that can be swiped on by other random users in the internet. It is intended to mimic the in person, peer to peer, low stakes gambling.

2. Description of what problem your project seeks to solve

- At minmium, this project will cover the ability to sign up, log in, and create a new bet that will be commited to the data base. At a strech goal, this will also cover the functionality for the application to allow a user to accept a bet and re-commit to the database. 

3. Description of what the technical components your project will be, including the routes, the data models, and any external sources you'll use

- Routes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-  /auth/signup: Route that Allows use to sign up for Application
    - POST
        - 400 Error Code for Empty or Missing Password
        - 200 for Positive Sign Up
        - 409 for Non-Unique Email Address.
-   auth/login: Route Signs users in to Application and Returns Token
    - POST
        - 400 Error for Empty or Missing Password
        - 401 When Password Doesn't Match
        - 200 & "res.body.token" with Token when Good Password is Provided.

- /bet/: User Specific CRUD Operations for Bets

      - 200 Code when Bet is created Successfully
      - 400 Code when a Required Field is Missing
      - 401 When Token is Missing, or Bad
  - GET: Allows Users to View ALL Their Own Bets
      - 200 Code and List of All Bets
      - 401 When Token is Missing or Bad

  - GET
      - 401 with bad or missing token
      - 200 with bet for admin or owner 
  - PUT
      - 401 with bad or missing token
      - 200 with bet for admin or owner
  - DELETE
      - 401 with bad or missing token
      - 200 for admin or owner. 
 
  
- /parlay/: Perform CRUD Operations on PARLAY - which are a combination of BETS. MUst be Owner of Parlay OR Admin to perform CRUD Operations
  - POST
  - GET
  - PUT
  - DELETE

- Data Models:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-   User:
  - _id (Mongoose Object)  
  - First Name (String)
  - Last Name (String)
  - Email (String / Unique)
  - Password (Encrypted String)
  - Account Balance (Integer)

- Bet:
  - _id (Mongoose Object)
  - BetInitiator (Mongoose User Object)
  - BetAcceptor (Mongood User Object) - Optional Parameter
  - Price (Integer)

- Parlay:
  - _id (Mongoose Object)
  - parlayInitiator (Mongoose User Object)
  - parlayBets (List of Mongood Bets)
  - parlayCost (Integer)
  

6. Clear and Direct Call outs of how you will meet various Project Requirements.

- Authentication and Authorization
-   Authentication and Authorization will be controlled via the "login" route with bcrypt and JWT

2  sets of CRUD routes (not counting authentication)
- See above routes. 

Indexes for performance and uniqueness when reasonable
  - Unqueness is controlled via User name and Bet IDs

At least one of text search, aggregations, and lookups

Routes should be fully tested (project test coverage > 80%)
  - Routes will be tested via JEST
    
Youâ€™ll demo your project to the class in week 10 (5 minutes)
  - Done In person
    
Demonstrate how to interact with your API

- Interactions will be completedvia POSTMAN Collection


8. Timeline for what project components you plan to comnplete, week by week, for the remainder of class
   - Week 7:
   -   Create Barebones Express Application and Routes
   -   Set up Basebones Mongoose Objects
   -   Start Writing Jest TEST w/ Expected responses
   - Week 8:
   -   Finish Jest Tests
   -   Further Develop Routes once JEST Tests are Complete
   - Week 9:
   -   Finish API Development
   -   Complete POSTMAN Routes for Class Presentation. 
   - Week 10:
   -   Present Project
